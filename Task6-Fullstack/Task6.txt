Task 6: Full Stack Application - Summary
In this task, I built a User Management System using full stack development concepts. I combined both frontend and backend to create a web application where users can add, view, update, and delete their profiles. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of what I did:

Backend (Node.js & Express)

Developed an API to handle CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
Connected the backend to a MongoDB database for storing user information.
Frontend (React.js)

Created a user interface to interact with the backend.
Used forms to add and update user data.
Displayed user information in a table format with options to edit or delete.
Database (MongoDB)

Stored and managed user data in a MongoDB database.
Connecting Frontend and Backend

Made HTTP requests from the React frontend to the Node.js backend using fetch or axios.
Ensured real-time updates on the frontend when user data is added, updated, or deleted.
Optional Feature (if included)

Implemented basic login authentication for additional security.
